# ChinookMusicWarehouse

## Overview
This is a simple ETL project that loads music purchase data from a JSON file containing OLTP database data into an OLAP data warehouse using Azure Synapse Analytics.

### Data Loading and Transformation

The source data from a `.json` file was manually loaded into an Azure container linked with Azure Synapse Analytics. It was then transformed using the PySpark pool in Azure Synapse Analytics. A dataframe was created for each table from the OLTP database and the data was saved in Parquet and Delta formats.

In the dedicated SQL Pool, external tables were created based on the transformed data, each representing a single OLTP database table. These tables were used to create staging tables for the data warehouse inside dedicated SQL Pool in Azure Synapse Analytics which were later used to load data into the data warehouse. The result was a fully functional data warehouse in Azure Synapse Analytics dedicated SQL pool, ready for further analysis using SQL queries, Power BI or other tools.
